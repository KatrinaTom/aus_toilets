# JavaScript Pratice

Welcome to my repository. The purpose of this exercise is to practice the following:

* DOM manipulation
* JavaScript Functions
* Introduction to CDN

## Exercise Example

The example is from CoderAcademy where the focus is on displaying data that is retrieved from an API.

Allowing me to practice dealing with arrays of objects returned from such APIs, and also practice adding information to a page using DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
